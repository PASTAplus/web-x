<h2>EDI Participates in the Research Data Alliance 20th Plenary Meeting 2023</h2>
<p>April 11, 2023</p>
<p>Paul Hanson, Margaret O'Brien, and Bob Waide</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Momentum continues to gather within the international community around FAIR data and FAIR science. RDA P20, held in
Gothenburg, Sweden, offered a forum for discussion within the global community around a variety of current topics,
ranging from the technical intricacies of identifiers, controlled vocabularies, and living data management plans to
broadscale strategic initiatives, such as global open research commons (GORC). For EDI, the meeting strengthened
international connections and provided the opportunity to express the needs and priorities of our community. As a data
repository for the environmental community, EDI directly relates to global consortia. The Australia Research Data
Commons (ARDC), Data Publisher for Earth and Environmental Science (PANGAEA), Indonesian National Scientific Repository,
African Open Science Platform (AOSP), the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), and the World Data System (WDS) are all
examples of concerted efforts to advance a new kind of science based on FAIR data. Whether exchanging ideas through
working groups and formal presentations or brainstorming new initiatives during social functions and hallway
discussions, EDI continues to promote the value of our environmental community and elevate its leadership within the
global data community.</p>
<p>Several interesting <a href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/rdas-20th-plenary-co-located-events-programme" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">co-located</a> events
occurred before and after the main meeting. For example, the DataCite Connect
<a href="https://datacite.org/datacite-connect-2023.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">meeting</a> on Monday focused on national Persistent Identifier (PID) and
Open Research strategies. Presentations by representatives of the National Library of Technology (CzechRepublic), the
Helmholtz Open Science Office (Germany), the National Roadmap for Persistent Identifiers (Netherlands), the Canadian
Research Knowledge Network, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Australian Research Data Consortium described plans
for the development of national PID guidelines. Although the US has not yet begun actions to develop a national plan,
recent guidance from the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/010422-NSPM-33-Implementation-Guidance.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">White
House</a> suggests that
we may be moving towards such a plan.</p>
<p>A summary of the <a href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/rdas-20th-plenary-highlights" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RDA 20th Plenary highlights</a> is available.
For those interested in learning more about the outcomes of RDA P20, the RDAâ€™s Technical Advisory Board will host a
webinar to share the takeaways of the breakout sessions held during the event and discuss the next steps. The webinar
will take place on Thursday, 20 April 2023, at 07:30 UTC and 17:00 UTC. Registration is open and available
<a href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/research-data-alliance-post-plenary-20-webinar" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. Recordings of sessions will be made
available to the general community on Monday, 1 May 2023. Check the RDA website for details.</p>
<p>The RDA 21st Plenary meeting will occur within <a href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/plenaries/international-data-week-2023-salzburg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IDW 2023: A Festival of
Data</a>, in Salzburg, Austria, on 23-26
October 2023. In 2024, RDA plans one fully virtual Plenary meeting and one hybrid Plenary meeting, with dates and
locations to be announced.</p>
