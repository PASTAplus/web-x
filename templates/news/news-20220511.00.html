<h4><a href="https://www.jointhepartnership.net" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Learning Partnership</a> and <a href="https://luquillo.lter.network" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Luquillo LTER</a> . Location: Remote . Mentor: Steven McGee (mcgee@lponline.net)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project description:</strong> The Fellow will support the <a href="https://czo-archive.criticalzone.org/national/education-outreach/resource/6317/lterlczo-schoolyard-data-jam/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Luquillo Schoolyard Data Jam initiative</a>. The essence of Data Jam is supporting middle- and high-school students in exploring, analyzing, and summarizing long-term data about the environment and then creatively communicating their discoveries to non-scientific audiences. One important element of Data Jam is providing students with appropriate datasets. The datasets need to be structured so that they are manageable, yet robust enough to support independent investigations. The Fellow will assist in creating new derived datasets by processing and combining LTER datasets. Data Jam’s next teacher workshop will be held in June 2022. The Fellow will attend the workshop to meet teachers and observe how teachers interact with the existing datasets. The Fellow will use teacher suggestions to process datasets in preparation for the beginning of the school year. The derived dataset will be published in the EDIT data repository.</li>

<h4><a href="https://ucnrs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of California Riverside, Natural Reserve System</a> . Location: Riverside, CA/Remote . Mentor: Marko Spasojevic (markos@ucr.edu)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project description:</strong> The Fellow will have the opportunity to archive two datasets collected in southern California, each featuring multiple years of climate data recorded either by sensors (James Reserve) or by hand (Deep Canyon). Core tasks for the Deep Canyon dataset would be creating a pipeline to input existing and future excel sheets and concatenating records into non-proprietary tabular formats (e.g., .csv) to archive in the EDI repository. For the James reserve data, core tasks will include trimming records to sensor in-situ dates, checking for erroneous records, applying existing R code to model minimum and maximum daily temperatures from semi-hourly data, and concatenating records into non-proprietary tabular formats (e.g., .csv) to archive in the EDI repository. The Fellow will also document each step as a workflow for ongoing projects and if time and the Fellow’s skillset allow, there are also opportunities to archive derived products of these data.</li>
