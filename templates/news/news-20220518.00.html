<h2>Audit Service Regression Causes EDI Data Portal System Errors</h2>
<p>May 18, 2022</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Starting on Tuesday 10 May 2022, the PASTA Audit Service began experiencing unexpected system shut downs that resulted in user errors when attempting to access data packages from the EDI Data Portal. These events required the Audit Service to be restarted multiples times during the remainder of the week and through the weekend. The cause of these shutdowns was determined to be the introduction of a new software feature into the Audit Services, which created a very large amount of XML data to be generated. This resulted in the Audit Service running out of system memory and ultimately the loss of the service. EDI software developers diagnosed the issue on Monday 16 May and deployed a patch on Monday evening. Unfortunately, regression testing did not catch this problem because of differences in the volume of the Audit Service database between our production system and development system. We regret any inconvenience this may have caused and thank all of our users for their patience in this matter.</p>
