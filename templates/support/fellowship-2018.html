<h2>About</h2>
<p>EDI successfully completed its first summer fellowship program from June 4 to August 13, 2018. Each of our six fellows made a significant contribution to the preservation and reuse of data and metadata that they published for their host sites. EDI will provide continued support to the host sites in maintaining the already archived data packages as well as in future data publishing efforts. Each fellow made a significant contribution to publishing the host site’s data, for long-term data preservation, making the data discoverable (in the <a href="https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/advancedSearch.jsp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EDI data repository</a>, <a href="https://www.dataone.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DataONE</a> and by internet searches) as well as to fulfill the requirements of scientific journals and funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation. We also supported the development and publishing of a workflow for marine image analysis.</p>
<h4>Testimonials</h4>
<p>“I feel immensely grateful to be part of the EDI Summer Fellowship 2018. This program has given me the unique opportunity to transition from more computer-based study in R Language to the real ecological data and its issue in field stations. I would not have been able to finish the internship without the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) training. The training and the internship not only has sharpened my skill in data management but also enhanced knowledge and awareness in ecology and conservation. Finally, the opportunity to regularly interact with such a diverse group of fellows and scientists has been invaluable to my personal and professional development.”</p>
<p>– Prita Novita | Fellow at the Adirondack Ecological Center –</p>
<p>“The EDI fellowship allowed the Plant Ecology Program to make great strides in publishing our long-term plant demographic data. We worked with fellow Gabriel Kamener and Vivienne Sclater of Archbold to get two complex datasets organized and posted. In addition, the procedures and coding that were created will make posting of additional datasets more feasible and improve the quality of those datasets.”</p>
<p>– Eric Menges, PhD | Senior Research Program Director and Research Biologist at Archbold Biological Station –</p>
<p>“EDI’s Ecological Data Management Summer Fellowship program has been a great benefit to Archbold Biological Station. Our fellow, Gabriel Kamener, was able to publish multiple datasets as well as clean one of our larger, more difficult datasets. Gabriel was able to give insightful feedback to researchers and was able to find answers to any questions they had. EDI’s commitment to the fellows benefitted Gabriel by providing mentorship and insight as well as Archbold by providing a trained employee to focus on data archiving and documenting the procedure for future use.”</p>
<p>– Vivienne Sclater | GIS and Data Manager at Archbold Biological Station –</p>
<p>“My Ecological Data Management Summer Fellowship with EDI provided the opportunity to successfully transition from collecting ecological data in the field to managing data and publicly archiving datasets with standardized metadata. EDI’s training workshop at the beginning of the fellowship program not only introduced me to the skills needed to tidy, document, and publish datasets, but it also offered the opportunity to work with data professionals and the other fellows in my cohort to overcome challenges involving messy data. Additionally, the hands-on experience in working with my mentor and researchers on data at Archbold Biological Station (ABS) allowed me to apply what I learned at the workshop, and it also allowed me to further expand my data-management skillset. The fellowship experience directly led to a job offer with ABS, and I now work as a Research Data Assistant in the station’s Data Management department.”</p>
<p>– Gabriel Kamener | EDI Summer fellow and Research Data Assistant at Archbold Biological Station –</p>
<p>“My co-authors and myself recently got a manuscript accepted in PlosOne. As part of the final submission, we were asked to publish/archive the data associated with our manuscript. Luckily, Gabriel Kamener (an EDI summer fellow) started his fellowship right at the same time. We asked him to prepare the data that were going to be sent to the EDI Data Repository. Gabriel fulfilled that task in a timely manner, updating me on the status of the dataset and making sure the data met the format requirements asked from EDI. Because Gabriel was familiar with EDI, it made the process of publishing this dataset painless and saved me much needed time to work on other projects.”</p>
<p>– Grégory Sonnier, PhD | Post-doctoral Research Fellow at Archbold Biological Station’s Buck Island Ranch –</p>
<p>“I spent this summer working at Shoals Marine Laboratory, ME. My goal was to clean, document, and archive data from the 30-year-plus long-term rocky intertidal monitoring program. There were challenges along the way, since the research program itself underwent many changes over the years; however, with support from numerous people at Shoals and at EDI, the dataset is now archived on the EDI portal. My experience with both the host site and with EDI mentors has been fulfilling and productive; I have learned much about how to communicate the importance of data quality to both practicing biologists and biologists-in-training. Most importantly, I have experienced first hand that there are both immense potential and challenges in working with long-term data, and that it takes constant ongoing work by dedicated people and organizations such as EDI to maintain and promote data quality and publication.”</p>
