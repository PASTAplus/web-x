<h2>About</h2>
<p>We successfully completed our second EDI Summer Fellowship Program (10 June – 9 August 2019). We supported nine fellows at host sites located in different parts of the country, studying a large variety of ecosystems, with the host institutions differing in size and data management resources. For a list of host sites, on-site mentors and fellows, see below.</p>
<p>Each fellow made a significant contribution to publishing the host site’s data, for long-term data preservation, making the data discoverable (in the <a href="https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/advancedSearch.jsp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EDI data repository</a>, <a href="https://www.dataone.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DataONE</a> and by internet searches) as well as to fulfill the requirements of scientific journals and funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation. We also supported the development and publishing of a workflow for marine image analysis.</p>
<h4>Highlights</h4>
<ul>
<li>EDI workshop on “Introduction to publishing environmental data” at <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/cafls/research/baruch/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Clemson Baruch Institute of Coastal Ecology and Forest Science</a> with support of EDI fellow Vanessa Bailey.</li>
<li>Fellow Katherine Qi with NES LTER shared her work in teleconferences with NASA, <a href="https://ioos.noaa.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Integrated Ocean Observing System</a>, and <a href="https://sbc.marinebon.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marine Biodiversity Observation Network</a> scientists and data managers. She developed workflows to contribute datasets from plankton imaging systems to EDI.</li>
<li>Fellows Katherine Le and Alexis Garretson continue to work with their former host sites, <a href="https://www.lacawac.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lacawac Sanctuary and Biological Field Station</a> and <a href="https://www.mohonkpreserve.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mohonk Preserve</a> on data management related tasks.</li>

<h4>Testimonials</h4>
<p>“I benefited greatly from the EDI summer fellowship program. The workshop in Albuquerque exposed me to data concepts that I hadn’t thought of before and improved my knowledge of data management best practices. Learning about metadata and the Ecological Metadata Language prepared me to help the people at the Baruch Institute of Coastal Ecology and Forest Science with their data. Working with data at the field station further gave me hands-on experience with different ecological data, their nuances, and associated troubleshooting. EDI support allowed the repository upload process to occur smoothly. I’ve made so many wonderful connections with other ecologists and data managers from this program. I feel extremely fortunate for the opportunity and hope to apply the skills I learned to my own data management in the future.”</p>
<p>– Vanessa Bailey | Fellow at Baruch Institute of Coastal Ecology and Forest Science, Field Station –</p>
<p>“The Environmental Data Initiative Fellowship Program was a great opportunity to connect with ESIP partner organizations while developing my information management expertise. The fellowship opened with an in-person crash course in data publishing, including instruction on cleaning and structuring datasets, on using and creating Ecological Metadata Language, and on publishing data packages in the EDI data repository. This training, combined with the hands-on experience in data management at Mohonk Preserve and other host sites, has helped me define and explore career opportunities in environmental information management roles.” (Excerpt from “How an ESIP Output Helped me in my Summer Fellowship”).</p>
<p>– Alexis Garretson | Fellow at Mohonk Preserve –</p>
<p>“Like many field stations, we accumulate a lot of data, and we’re eager to make it accessible to a broader research community. It seems like such an insurmountable task, and starting the process of cleaning up even one dataset for publication was daunting. We were so fortunate to have a really talented, well-trained EDI Fellow, Alexis Garretson, to spend the summer with us. Alexis was able to quickly and efficiently format and publish some of our simpler datasets, and made tremendous strides cleaning up an unwieldy dataset that we’ve been struggling with for years. We’re already benefiting from her work- just this week I was able to provide the doi for one of the datasets Alexis worked on to a researcher at another institution who wants to include the data in a project he’s working on.”</p>
<p>– Dr. Elizabeth Long | Director of Conservation Science at Mohonk Preserve –</p>
<p>“The training I received through EDI’s Summer Fellowship Program has helped me to enhance my skillset in programming and data management. This past summer, I had the opportunity to attend EDI’s training workshop where I met a welcoming group of like-minded individuals and together, we learned how to use R to clean up messy data, translate metadata into EML, and publish data packages to EDI. Following the training workshop, I got to apply what I learned to formatting and publishing decades of water temperature, meteorological, and dissolved oxygen sensor data at Lacawac Sanctuary and Biological Field Station. Throughout the process, I always had support from EDI and the other fellows when I needed it. In addition, my mentor Beth at Lacawac was always more than willing to help and answer any questions I had. Through this program, I learned valuable skills in overcoming challenges associated with maintaining long-term data. In addition, this fellowship led me to continue on as a data manager for Lacawac Field Station.”</p>
<p>– Katherine Le | Fellow at the Lacawac Sanctuary and Biological Field Station –</p>
<p>“As an undergraduate student pursuing a career in research, experience in working directly with scientists and real life problems is essential. Environmental Data Initiative provided a supportive program that allowed me to engage with data scientists, engineers, and ocean biologists at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute this summer. I was able advance my own software skills and proficiency in plankton ecology while developing a project that directly influenced many working groups. Without the great mentoring and training I received through EDI and WHOI, I would not have been able to accomplish and learn as much as I did in this short period of time. This opportunity was a unique insight into the importance of data analysis and management, and I now understand how these techniques are applicable to all fields.”</p>
<p>– Katherine Qi |Fellow at the Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-term Ecological Research (NES-LTER), Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution –</p>
<p>“This summer we had the wonderful opportunity to host Kathy Qi as an Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) Fellow. Kathy’s project was a big success for NES-LTER and is already having impact in the broader community – Kathy got to share her work in telecons with NASA, IOOS, and MBON scientists and data managers! Thank you again for this opportunity, what a great fellowship program.” Please read more in this post.</p>
