<h2>About</h2>
<p>We successfully completed our third EDI Summer Fellowship Program (9 June – 14 August 2020). Due to the COVID-19 health situation, we moved the entire program online, including the ecological data publishing training for the fellows. We supported ten fellows who conducted data management and publishing work for host sites located in different parts of the country. For a list of host sites, on-site mentors and fellows, see below. Thanks to the fellows’ and mentors’ effort to regularly meet online, the fellowship was successful in terms of learning about data management and working with scientific teams of the host sites. Each fellow made a significant contribution to publishing the host site’s data, for long-term data preservation, making the data discoverable (in the <a href="https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/advancedSearch.jsp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EDI data repository</a>, <a href="https://www.dataone.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DataONE</a> and by internet searches).</p>

<h2>Testimonials</h2>
<p>“The task of making environmental data publicly available and reusable is often overlooked. The training that I received during my EDI summer fellowship opened my eyes to the world of data management. Great care and thought are required for good data archiving and EDI provided great resources and training for doing so. The staff at EDI were highly knowledgeable and always willing to help answer my questions. I felt very supported by both my host site and EDI. The fellowship offered a rare combination of training and hands-on experience to learn, practice, and grow my data management skills and I’m very grateful for the opportunity.”</p>
<p>– Ashley Whipple | Fellow at Pepperwood Preserve – (see also Ashley’s blog entry on <a href="https://www.pepperwoodpreserve.org/2020/07/30/mydatasdata-a-metadata-story/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“My data’s data: a metadata story”</a>)</p>
<p>“I am extremely grateful to have been a part of EDI’s 2020 summer fellowship at the University of California Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory (SNARL). My goal this summer was to clean, organize, and publish the Sierra Lakes Inventory Project, a long-term dataset of community composition for approximately 8,000 lakes in the Sierras. This experience improved my skills in data management and R, as I had to work with ‘real-life’ ecological data. The fellowship also provided an opportunity for me to make an impact on the future of conservation and restoration in the Sierra’s and opened my eyes to the world of data science. I would highly recommend this fellowship to anyone interested in data management and ecology!”</p>
