<h4>About</h4>
<p>We successfully completed our fourth EDI Fellowship Program (21 June – 19 August 2021). Due to the COVID-19 health situation, we conducted the data publishing training online. Most of the Fellows engaged with the host projects remotely. We supported 16n fellows who conducted data management and publishing work for host projects located in different parts of the country and Costa Rica. For a list of host sites, on-site mentors and fellows, see below. Each fellow made a significant contribution to publishing the host site’s data, developing publishing workflows and to long-term data preservation, making the data discoverable (in the <a href="https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/advancedSearch.jsp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EDI data repository</a>, <a href="https://www.dataone.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DataONE</a> and by internet searches).</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.baylor.edu/crasr/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Baylor University, Center for Aquatic Systems Research (CRASR)</a>. Location: Remote. Mentor: Stephen Powers (s_powers@baylor.edu), Fellow: Jessica Hicks</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project description:</strong> CRASR facilitates research on aquatic systems inclusive to biogeochemistry, ecology, and human health considerations. CRASR operates a shared water chemistry lab that applies analytical methods supported by EPA guidance (e.g., total phosphorus, major ions) to analyze many thousand samples each year. The Fellow will synthesize, disseminate and publish a variety of CRASR water data. Three existing datasets involve water quality monitoring of surface water bodies of Central Texas: Lake Waco (biogeochemistry, vertical profiles of dissolved oxygen and water temperature) and Richland-Chambers Reservoir (continuous sensor data from multi-parameter sondes). Depending on the Fellow’s interest, many other CRASR water datasets are available for archiving. In summer 2021, CRASR plans to begin disseminating data subsets using an online Rshiny data dashboard and the Fellow could be part of the development.</li>

This work will include data cleaning and prep work using R or SQL. The Fellow will also be tasked with archiving datasets from closed projects. Depending on time and interest, the Fellow could also be involved in two additional initiatives: (1) database normalization to create a relational database integrating JN “sightings” database and “registration” database; and (2) integration of selected JN datasets into data visualizations using Tableau. At the close of this fellowship, the Fellow will present their work to the UW-Madison Arboretum staff and write an article for publication on the Journey North and Arboretum online news channels.</li>
