<h2>Organizing data into publishable units</h2>
<p>July 31, 2018</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Organizing data into publishable units can be challenging because itâ€™s often influenced by multiple factors including: data theme and volume, the unique needs of providers and users, the level of processing required, and the general purpose the data serve. To inform a set of guidelines for organizing data into publishable units we had an open discussion to share experiences, issues, and recommendations.</p>
