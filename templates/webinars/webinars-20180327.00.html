<h2>Make metadata with the EML assembly line</h2>
<p>March 27, 2018</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>High quality structured metadata is essential to the persistence and reuse of ecological data; however, creating such metadata requires substantial technical expertise and effort. To accelerate the production of metadata in the Ecological Metadata Language (EML), weâ€™ve created the EMLassemblyline R code package. Assembly line operators supply the data and information about the data, then the machinery auto-extracts additional content and translates it all to EML. In this webinar Colin presented an overview of the assembly line, how to operate it, and a brief demonstration of its use on an example dataset.</p>
