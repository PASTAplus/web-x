<h2>Going Static with LTER Websites</h2>
<p>May 29, 2018</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Nearly all Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) websites employ dynamic servers that facilitate authoring content via Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress or Drupal, or which generate content on the fly as end users request a given page in their browser.  While powerful, such systems also have a cost related to security updates for the CMS or operation of the server itself.  In this webinar we introduce an alternative called static websites, in which web pages are created ahead of time and served exactly as they are stored on the server. Server costs tend to be much lower for static websites, and CMS security updates become a thing of the past.  We will explore BLE’s static website, and demonstrate how to utilize external servers to support a searchable bibliography via Zotero or data catalog via PASTA+. The bibliography and data catalog components (as well as the entire BLE website) are available on GitHub for you to see how they’re implemented, collaborate on improving them, or simply download them for your own site.</p>
