			    <div><h3>Keep Your Science Up-to-Date with EDI Repository Event Notifications</h3><br><p>Science that is based wholly or in part on data archived in the EDI repository can utilize our event notification service to be notified anytime input data changes. Ultimately, this accelerates science, enables projects to live beyond their completion date, encourages reproducibility, and allows you to do more by reducing manual tasks. Join us for an in-depth look at EDI repository event notifications, what they are, how they work, and how to get started using them. <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUqcuivrD4pG9AwHKz5qm3nb-mEgROLxYZx" target="_blank">Register</a></p>

			    <div><h3>Normalization of Creator Names in EDI’s Data Portal</h3><br><p>The Advanced Search feature of EDI’s Data Portal lets you select a dataset Creator name from a drop-down list of all dataset creators in our repository. The search then displays all the datasets that have that name as one of its creators. Unfortunately, many creators’ names occur in multiple variations in different datasets and, in the past, each variation appeared separately in the drop-down list. We have recently created web services that implement this kind of names normalization, and the EDI Data Portal is now using the normalized names. <a href="https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/2021/11/02/normalization-creator-names-edi/" target="_blank">Read more.</a></p>
