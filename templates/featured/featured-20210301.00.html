<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This featured data package relates to a recent data paper in Global Ecology and Biogeography, describing a database of freshwater insect occurrences and traits for the contiguous United States (Twardochleb et al. 2021). The lead author, Laura Twardochleb, is a senior environmental scientist with the California Department of Water Resources.</p>

<p>Freshwater insects comprise 60% of the diversity of freshwater animals and are essential indicators of ecosystem health. Yet our knowledge of the distribution of freshwater insect diversity in the United States is incomplete because we lack comprehensive data on freshwater insect distributions and traits at a continental scale. Under Laura’s lead, this knowledge gap was filled by compiling and publishing a database of occurrence records and functional traits for freshwater insects in the contiguous US and presenting the database in the above mentioned data publication. The database can be used to map freshwater insect taxonomic and functional diversity, and when paired with environmental data, will provide a powerful resource for quantifying how the environment shapes diversity patterns as well as taxon-specific distributions across the continguous US.</p>
<p>The authors compiled over 2.05 million genus occurrence records for 932 genera in the major freshwater insect orders, at 51,044 stream locations sampled between 2001 and 2018 by federal and state biological monitoring programs. </p>

<p>Compared with existing open‐access databases, the authors tripled the number of occurrence records and locations and added records for 118 genera, nearly doubled the number of traits for 11 trait groups and added traits for 180 genera that were not available from open‐access databases. In the database, information is assembled on life history, dispersal, morphology, and ecology traits from existing databases, scientific books, and the primary literature, and present traits and trait affinities for 1,072 insect genera. The database contains georeferenced occurrence records and traits for
stream insects a grain of about 1 square meter. The temporal resolution is daily. The major taxa and level of measurement are: Genera from the orders Coleoptera, Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, Megaloptera, Neuroptera, Odonata, Plecoptera and Trichoptera. The figure (left) presents the freshwater insect genus richness by occurrence location for all (a) and individual (b) insect orders across the continental United States.</p>
