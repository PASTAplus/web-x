<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This data package is a great example of re-using environmental data that were collected and published previously. EDI actively promotes and enables the re-use of environmental data.</p>

<p>This data package includes data that were compiled from a scientific literature review. The data points were extracted from 78 papers, published between 1996 and 2018. Manuscripts were considered in which ecological indices were used to assess the impact of different environmental stressors on local aquatic environments in Argentina. About 40% of the studies applied ecological indices to assess the impact of land use (mainly urbanization, agriculture, cattle rising and industry) on ecosystem health. 38% of the considered manuscripts studied the Pampas which makes it the most studied region in this literature review. Figure 1 shows a typical aquatic environment in the Pampas region of Argentina. Figure 2 shows the sampling sites across different ecoregions in Argentina that were classified according to Burkart et al. (1999). The data package furthermore includes a shapefile that shows sampling sites categorized by the ecological indices that were used in a forthcoming manuscripts’ analysis: physico-chemical, biological, geomorphological and multimetric.</p>
