<h1>Data Services</h1>
<p>We provide <strong>comprehensive research data support</strong> for departments, research groups and projects, including for proposal writing and grant execution. <strong>Our goal</strong> is to maximize the value of research data and catalyze new research opportunities.</p>
<p>Managing data for new science requires specialized expertise and significant human effort. The Environmental Data Institute is ready to provide efficient support with data scientists trained in environmental science and a certified data repository.</p>
<p><strong>Our services</strong> are available through support packages with costs related to the complexity of the project. Ask for a free consultation.</p>
