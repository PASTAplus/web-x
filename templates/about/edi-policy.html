<h1 id="edi-policy">EDI Policy</h1>

<h2 id="data-policy">Data policy</h2>
<p>Version 0.0, Adopted 25 November 2019</p>
<p>The Environmental Data Initiative (herein EDI) provides services defined as publication and archive of science data to communities world-wide. In accordance with the EDI scope and mission, the following Data Policy statement declares an agreed upon understanding between EDI and the individual or individuals responsible for any and all data submitted to the EDI data repository for the purposes of publication and archive.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<p>The following definitions are used throughout this Data Contributor Policy</p>
<p><strong>EDI data contributor</strong>. An individual or individuals who are responsible for submitting a data package to the EDI data repository for the purpose of data publication and archive.</p>
<p><strong>EDI customer</strong>. An individual or individuals who utilizes EDI's data publication and archive service.</p>
<p><strong>EDI data repository</strong>. An Internet-based scientific data repository service for scientific data publication and archive.</p>
<p><strong>EDI data publication and archive</strong>. The process by which scientific data and metadata are made discoverable and available through EDI computational infrastructure, including the long-term curation and management of such data.</p>
<p><strong>EDI website</strong>. The official EDI Internet website (<a href="https://environmentaldatainitiative.org">https://environmentaldatainitiative.org</a>) where general information about EDI, including policies, news, events, and featured scientific data may be accessed.</p>
<p><strong>Science Data</strong>. Data collected by external parties that is published and archived by EDI.</p>
<p><strong>Science Data Package</strong>. The aggregate product produced by combining science data with science metadata.</p>
<p><strong>Science Metadata</strong>. Textual metadata describing scientific data that is published and archived by EDI</p>
<h3 id="data-package-accessibility">Data package accessibility</h3>
<p>EDI strives to make environmental research data open and accessible to the general public without undue restrictions or barriers. Although EDI strongly recommends all data be publicly available, we recognize that some data may require limited access while it is under review during manuscript preparation. In these cases, the EDI Data Repository supports access control to data when justified by the data provider, thereby limiting exposure of the data resource to only users with appropriate permission <sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup>. Such access control must be clearly specified in the data package metadata. EDI will also accept data that requires a permanent embargo due to issues of sensitivity (e.g., the location of endangered species or antiquities). Although EDI will enforce access control of data as specified in the data package metadata, EDI does not guarantee the privacy of such information. If data are to be submitted to the EDI Data Repository with restricted access, we request that an explanation of the data embargo, including if and when the data will be made available to the general public, be provided in the data entity description field of the data package metadata. Only for extreme circumstances will EDI allow both the metadata and data to be restricted <sup><a href="#footnotes">2</a></sup>. EDI reserves the right to periodically review restricted data to determine if embargos continue to be justified.</p>
<h3 id="sensitive-data">Sensitive data</h3>
<p>Under no circumstance will EDI knowingly accept data that is protected by Federal, State, or local laws and policies (e.g., FERPA, HIPAA, or IRB restrictions on human subject data). In addition, science metadata often contains personal data of individuals involved in scientific research. These personal data may be available to other EDI customers and the general public through an EDI website. EDI requires that the individual(s) responsible for submitting science data packages to EDI acknowledge that such science data and metadata is not restricted by any governing laws and policies or that personal data within science metadata is included with the explicit knowledge and permission of the individual or individuals it affects.</p>
<h3 id="offline-data">Offline data</h3>
<p>There is an option to declare data "offline" within the distribution field of the data package metadata. Doing so eliminates the need to have data be "network" accessible to the EDI Data Repository during the data package upload process. The use of offline data is only recommended for data that are too voluminous for network or storage capacity, such as the output from numerical models. Offline data must be provided to the EDI Data Repository through alternative means (e.g., SSD drive via a common carrier) prior to uploading the data package metadata. EDI requests that an explanation of the offline status be provided in the data entity description field of the data package metadata, including the preferred method of data distribution if required to satisfy a data request. See here for details: .</p>
<h3 id="intellectual-rights-of-the-data-contributor">Intellectual rights of the data contributor</h3>
<p>EDI makes every effort to ensure that all data are curated with intellectual rights defined by the data provider as found in the data package metadata. Although EDI advocates for open and unfettered access to data packages without use restrictions, we do not forbid data providers from declaring more restrictive licensing agreements for use of their data packages. Data providers should include a statement of Intellectual Rights in the metadata of their submissions. If they do not, EDI reserves the right to add a default declaration of intellectual rights to the data package metadata. The default declaration of intellectual rights used by EDI is based on the Creative Commons CC0 "No Rights Reserved" waiver. See below for the full default statement:</p>
<p><em>This data package is released to the "public domain" under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons CC0 1.0</a> "No Rights Reserved". It is considered professional etiquette to provide attribution of the original work if this data package is shared in whole or by individual components. A generic citation is provided for this data package on <a href="https://portal.edirepository.org">the website</a> (herein "website") in the summary metadata page. Communication (and collaboration) with the creators of this data package is recommended to prevent duplicate research or publication. This data package (and its components) is made available "as is" and with no warranty of accuracy or fitness for use. The creators of this data package and the website shall not be liable for any damages resulting from misinterpretation or misuse of the data package or its components. Periodic updates of this data package may be available from the website. Thank you.</em></p>
<h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy policy</h2>
<p>Version 1.0, Adopted 10 October 2019</p>
<p>The Environmental Data Initiative (herein EDI) publishes this Privacy Policy to inform you, our customers, of the collection, use, and disclosure ("Processing") of personal data by the EDI project, its computational infrastructure, and scientific partners during the operation of data publication and archive (collectively, our "services"). This Privacy Policy is effective 2 October 2019, and may be amended in the future.</p>
<h3 id="definitions_1">Definitions</h3>
<p>The following definitions are used throughout this Privacy Policy:</p>
<p><strong>Authenticated customer</strong>. A customer whose identity has been verified through a means of challenge, such as providing a password or other item of information that only the customer would know.</p>
<p><strong>EDI authentication token</strong>. A custom web browser cookie that contains authentication information about the customer to enable PASTA+ software access control mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>EDI customer</strong>. An individual or organization that utilizes one or more services provided by EDI.</p>
<p><strong>EDI data repository</strong>. An Internet-based scientific data repository service for scientific data publication and archive.</p>
<p><strong>EDI data publication and archive</strong>. The process by which scientific data and metadata are made discoverable and available through EDI computational infrastructure, including the long-term curation and management of such data.</p>
<p><strong>EDI website</strong>. The official EDI Internet <a href="https://environmentaldatainitiative.org">website</a> where general information about EDI, including policies, news, events, and featured scientific data may be accessed.</p>
<p><strong>EDI workshop</strong>. An organized and scheduled effort by EDI (or scientific partner) personnel to disseminate educational materials related to scientific data publication and archive to EDI customers.</p>
<p><strong>PASTA+ software</strong>. <a href="https://github.com/PASTAplus/PASTA">The software</a> developed, maintained, and used by EDI to provide its data publication and archive service.</p>
<p><strong>Personal data</strong>. Data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, which may include: common name, surname, given name, email address, organizational associations (name, address, phone), and or unique identifier (such as ORCID or GitHub identity).</p>
<p><strong>Science Data</strong>. Data collected by external parties that is published and archived by EDI.</p>
<p><strong>Science Metadata</strong>. Textual metadata describing scientific data that is published and archived by EDI</p>
<h3 id="why-and-how-we-collect-personal-data">Why and how we collect personal data</h3>
<ol>
<li>Dissemination of EDI news and updates. EDI sends news items and updates about our project, operation, and services to EDI customers who subscribe to such information. Customers must actively submit personal data, including: email (required), surname (optional), given name (optional), organization (optional), and organizational role (optional), to EDI's <a href="https://mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a> account. These personal data are not shared with any 3rd party or partner.</li>
<li>Customer identity information for authorization to EDI data repository services and scientific data and metadata. EDI restricts access to some data repository services (e.g., publishing and archiving scientific data) to a subset of customers who have agreed to our data publication policy. In addition, customers who contribute science data and metadata have the option to apply access control to their data and metadata to limit distribution of their products. Customers who identify through an EDI accepted authentication protocol can be filtered against one or more rules used to allow or deny access to EDI data repository services or scientific data and metadata. Customers who require the ability to publish and archive science data and metadata must request an EDI LDAP account through an EDI representative. An EDI LDAP account requires a unique customer identifier composed into an LDAP distinguished name, given name, surname, and valid email address. Customers who only require identification to access controlled science data or metadata may use a third party identity service (either Google, GitHub, or ORCID) to verify their identity; successful authentication through the third party stores either the customer's gmail email address, GitHub home location, or ORCID identifier, respectively, into the active EDI web browser session, in addition to the customer's common name.</li>
<li>Customer email or other contact information. EDI customers may register contact information with EDI for the purpose of notification when the creation, addition, or modification of science data and metadata that is curated by EDI occurs within the EDI data repository. Notifications of this type serve to inform customers when new or updated science data are added to the system or to alert customers when science data are found to be suspect or erroneous post-publication. The collection of customer contact information is an option provided to EDI customers during an authenticated web browser session. Customer contact information includes only an email address.</li>
<li>Web browser session cookies and authentication tokens. EDI websites utilize web browser session cookies and authentication tokens to maintain an authenticated state between the customer's web browser and EDI's website services. Session cookies are generated by the EDI website and authentication tokens are generated by the EDI authentication service at the point a customer self-identifies. EDI authentication tokens include the customer's unique identifier, a token time-to-live, and any membership in recognized roles or groups.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="security-of-collected-personal-data">Security of collected personal data</h3>
<p>All collected personal data are transmitted using HTTP SSL encryption when on the open Internet and restricted behind EDI system firewalls when operated on within the EDI data repository service oriented architecture.</p>
<h3 id="personal-data-found-within-science-metadata">Personal data found within science metadata</h3>
<p>Personal data may be found within science metadata in the form of contact information pertaining to the origin of the science data and metadata. EDI does not actively collect such personal data; such personal data is provided by EDI customers who wish to publish and archive science data and metadata. EDI does require customers to acknowledge that the owners of this personal data have agreed to its release as part of the publication process. This type of personal data (i.e., contact information) is critical for consumers of science data and metadata to better determine the nature and origin of the science data and metadata when ascertaining fitness for use. In addition, science metadata may contain customer unique identifiers to enable the processing of access control.</p>
<h3 id="transparency-and-sharing-of-personal-data">Transparency and sharing of personal data</h3>
<p>EDI records customer identity information, if available, within EDI's activity audit to better understand what and when published science data and metadata are accessed within the EDI data repository. This information is coupled with the date and time of access and the science data or metadata that is accessed. This information may be summarized and provided to our funding agencies to justify continued operations. In addition, EDI may share the same detailed audit information with customers who contribute science data and metadata so that they may better understand the reuse and efficacy of their science data and metadata publication.</p>
<h3 id="personal-data-retention-access-and-removal-of-personal-data">Personal data retention, access and removal of personal data</h3>
<p>EDI retains the aforementioned personal data within EDI's computational infrastructure for an indefinite period of time. Upon written request to support@environmentaldatainitiative.org and with proper identification, EDI will provide the requested with a report of all recorded instances of personal data in digital format and or remove all instances of personal data.</p>
<h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of conduct</h2>
<p>The Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) is an NSF funded project helping to accelerate the curation and archive of environmental data. We operate and maintain a reliable, registered, and certified trustworthy data repository for ecological research data. EDI provides training on the data archiving process as well as data management best practices through events such as webinars, workshops and fellowships as well as individual support by EDI's information managers.</p>
<p>EDI is committed to providing a safe, productive and welcoming environment for all participants and staff while at any EDI sponsored event or venue.</p>
<p>All participants (including, but not limited to, attendees, speakers, instructors, fellows and their hosts, volunteers, contractors, EDI staff and guests) are expected to abide by this Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies in all venues, including ancillary events and social gatherings, whether officially sponsored by EDI or not.</p>
<h3 id="expected-behavior">Expected behavior</h3>
<ul>
<li>Treat all participants, attendees, fellows, staff, and vendors with kindness, respect and consideration, valuing a diversity of views and opinions (including those you may not share).</li>
<li>Communicate openly with respect for other participants, critiquing ideas rather than individuals.</li>
<li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech directed toward others, whether in person, in print, or online.</li>
<li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.</li>
<li>Respect the rules and policies of the meeting venue.</li>
<li>Abide by principles of academic integrity and ethical professional conduct.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="unacceptable-behavior">Unacceptable behavior</h3>
<ul>
<li>Harassment, intimidation or discrimination in any form is unacceptable. Harassment includes speech or behavior that is not welcome or is personally offensive. Behavior that is acceptable to one person may not be acceptable to another, so use discretion to be sure respect is communicated.<ul>
<li>Verbal harassment includes comments, epithets, slurs, threats, and negative stereotyping that are offensive, hostile, disrespectful, or unwelcome.</li>
<li>Non-verbal harassment includes actions or distribution, display, or discussion of any written or graphic material that ridicules, denigrates, insults, belittles, or shows hostility, aversion, or disrespect toward a group or individual. The use of sexual and/or discriminatory images in public spaces or in presentations is also considered harassment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Examples of unacceptable behavior include—but are not limited to—unwelcome or offensive verbal comments related to age, appearance or body size, employment or military status, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, individual lifestyle, marital status, national origin, physical or cognitive ability, political affiliation, sexual orientation, race, or religion.</li>
<li>Retaliation and reporting an incident in bad faith both undermine the safe, productive and welcoming environment we are striving to create and will also be subject to consequences.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>
<p>EDI reserves the right to enforce this Code of Conduct in any manner deemed appropriate. Except in the most egregious cases, anyone violating the Code of Conduct will first be asked to cease these behaviors. Failure to comply with requests can result in escalating consequences which may include expulsion from the event or prohibition from future events.</p>
<h3 id="reporting">Reporting</h3>
<p>If you are the subject of unacceptable behavior or have witnessed any such behavior, please immediately notify a member of the EDI staff, preferably one of the principal investigators, Corinna Gries or Mark Servilla.</p>
<p>Anyone experiencing or witnessing behavior that constitutes an immediate or serious threat to individual or public safety at any of the events organized by EDI is advised to contact venue security or local law enforcement.</p>
<div id="footnotes"></div>
<ol>
<li>Access to science metadata and data must be granted explicitly within the data package metadata (access is denied by default). Data packages containing restricted data (i.e., not publicly accessible) will not be shared with DataONE. <a href="#data-package-accessibility">[back]</a></li>
<li>The restriction of an entire data package (both metadata and data) should be arranged with EDI prior to submitting the data package to the data repository. Data packages that do not allow public access to both science metadata and data will not receive a Digital Object Identifier. <a href="#data-package-accessibility">[back]</a></li>
